# Bike-sharing-project

**Introduction**: The focus of this udacity project is to build a vanilla neural network to predict the number of bike-shares based on several attributes given in the data set. The 
network here is build from scratch using Numpy. The dataset comprising attributes as : Month, day, temperature, humidity, weather situation and others is preprocessed by pandas.

**components:**
* my_answers: A python file defining The network class and its functions: (__init__, train, run, etc.). In this python file also the hayperparamters need to declared
* Predicting_bike_sharing_data.ipynb: In this notebook the dataset is preprocessed withb pandas. Then the netwwork is run and trained through backproagation. The training losses of the networks 
are shown in matplotlib figures.
